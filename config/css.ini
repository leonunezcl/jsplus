accelerator=Specifies whether or not the element has an accelerator key, which is a shortcut for selecting the element.
azimuth=Specifies the speaker balance for audio content.
background=Defines the background properties for an element.        
background-attachment=This property sets the background image to scroll or not to scroll with its associated element's content. The default value is scroll, which sets the background to scroll with the associated content, typically text. The alternate value, fixed, is intended to make the background static with associated content such as text scrolls on top. This property is often used to create a watermark effect similar to the proprietary attribute, bgproperties, of the <body> tag introduced by Microsoft.
background-color=This property sets an element's background color. It is often used in conjunction with the color property, which sets text color. If both are not set it is possible to have rendering problems and the W3C CSS validator will warn of this issue. Used with block elements, this property colors content and padding but not margins. The default value, transparent, allows any underlying content to show through.
background-image=This property associates a background image with an element. Underlying content may show through transparent regions in the source image. The background image requires a URL (complete or relative) to link it to the source image specified with the url( ) syntax. The default value is none and sets the background so that it doesn't display an image.
background-position=This property determines how a background image is positioned within the canvas space used by its associated element. The position of the background image's upper-left corner can be specified as an absolute distance in pixels from the surrounding element's origin. It can also be specified as a percentage along the horizontal and vertical dimensions. Finally, the position can be specified as named values that describe the horizontal and vertical dimensions. The named values for the horizontal axis are center, left, and right; those for the vertical axis are top, center, and bottom. The default value for an unspecified dimension is assumed to be center.
background-position-x=Specifies the x-position of a background image for an element.
background-position-y=Specifies the x-position of a background image for an element.
background-repeat=This value determines how background images tile when they are smaller than the canvas space used by their associated elements. It is used in conjunction with the background-image property. Possible values are repeat (repeats in both direction), repeat-x (repeats only horizontally), repeat-y (repeats vertically), and no-repeat. The default value is repeat.
border=Defines the border properties for an element.    
border-bottom=This property defines the width, style, and color for the bottom border of an element in a shorthand form. 
border-bottom-color=This property defines the color of an element's bottom border.
border-bottom-style=This property defines the style for the bottom border of an element. Allowed values are none, dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, and outset. See border-style property for specific information on each style.
border-bottom-width=This property sets the width of an element's bottom border. Values can be keywords (thin, medium, or thick) and numerical lengths such as pixels (px), inches (in), and so on.
border-collapse=This CSS2 property defines if table cell borders are connected or separate. Allowed values are separate and collapse. With a value of collapse, the borders appear to collapse on each other so that there's no more spacing between the borders. A rendering here in Internet Explorer 6 should illustrate the idea of the property.
border-color=This property defines the color of an element's border. All borders are set at once but individual color values can be set with the shorthand border-top, border-right, border-bottom, and border-left.
border-left=This property defines the width, style, and color for the left border of an element in a shorthand form. 
border-left-color=This property defines the color of an element's left border.
border-left-style=This property defines the style for the left border of an element. Allowed values are none, dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, and outset.
border-left-width=This property sets the width of an element's left border. Values can be keywords (thin, medium, or thick) and numerical lengths such as pixels (px), inches (in), and so on.
border-right=This property defines the width, style, and color for the bottom border of an element in a shorthand form.
border-right-color=This property defines the color of an element's right border.
border-right-style=This property defines the style for the right border of an element. Allowed values are none, dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, and outset.
border-right-width=This property sets the width of an element's right border. Values can be keywords (thin, medium, or thick) and numerical lengths such as pixels (px), inches (in), and so on.
border-spacing=This CSS2 property is similar to the cellspacing attribute on the table element in HTML/XHTML and defines the space between cells in a table. Its value can be an arbitrary length, but not negative. If one length is specified, it gives both the horizontal and vertical spacing. If two are specified, the first gives the horizontal spacing and the second the vertical spacing between cells.
border-style=The border-style property defines the style of up to four different sides of a border, using the values none, dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, and outset.
border-top=This property defines the width, style, and color for the top border of an element in a shorthand form.
border-top-color=This property defines the color of an element's top border.
border-top-style=This property defines the style for the top border of an element. Allowed values are none, dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, and outset.
border-top-width=This property sets the width of an element's top border. Values can be keywords (thin, medium, or thick) and numerical lengths such as pixels (px), inches (in), and so on.
border-width=This property sets the width of an element's complete border. Values can be keywords (thin, medium, or thick) and numerical lengths. The border-width property can also be used to specify all four borders individually in the standard top, right, bottom, left style.
bottom=This property defines the y (vertical) coordinate for a positioned element, relative to the bottom of the enclosing element or browser window. Values can be specified as lengths (inches, pixels, and so on), as a percentage of the containing object's dimensions, or as auto, which lets this property function as determined by the browser or as defined by the parent element.
caption-side=This property defines the position of a caption element within a table. It may take left, right, top or bottom as a value. A value of top will typically default in a browser.
clear=This property specifies the placement of an element in relation to floating objects. Possible values are left, right, both, and none. The property acts much like the clear attribute for the <br> tag and continues to return until the left, right, or both columns are clear. The default value is none.
clip=This property sets the coordinates of the clipping rectangle that houses the content of elements. The allowed clipping shape is a rectangle defined rect (top right bottom left) where the values specify offsets from the respective sides of the containing box. Eventually, other shapes may be possible.
color=This property sets the color of text. Values can be specified as color names, hex values in three or six-digit format, or red-green-blue (RGB) values (numbers or percentages).
content=This property generates content in a document and is used with the :before and :after pseudo-elements. Values for the property include string, url, counter, open-quote, close-quote, no-open-quote, no-close-quote, and attr(X).
counter-increment=This property accepts one or more names of counter names, each one optionally followed by an integer. The integer indicates by how much the counter is incremented or decremented for every occurrence of the element. The default increment is 1.
counter-reset=This property contains a list of one or more counter names, each one optionally followed by an integer. The integer gives the value that the counter is set to on each occurrence of the element. The default value is 0.
cue=Defines the properties for an aural cue before or after an element.
cue-after=Defines the properties for an aural cue after an element.
cue-before=Defines the properties for an aural cue before an element.    
cursor=This property determines how the cursor displays when passed over the affected element. The auto value leaves the display to be determined by the user agent, so the cursor will display according to either the browser default settings or the user settings.
direction=The direction property is used to control the text direction much like the attribute dir for various HTML/XHTML tags. The allowed values are rtl (right to left) and ltr (left to right). While the direction property can easily affect block elements, for it to affect inline-level elements, the unicode-bidi property value must be embed or override.
display=This property specifies an element's display type and can override an element's defined display type. For example, block-level elements can be redefined as inline elements so that extra lines will not be placed between them. The allowed values for display under CSS1 are inline, block, list-item, and none. The value of none completely removes an element from the document tree and unlike the hidden value of the visibility property, none does not preserve an element's canvas space.
elevation=Specifies the elevation of the element. You can either one of the relative elevations or specify an angle in degrees.
empty-cells=This CSS2 property is used to control whether or not borders show on empty table cells. It takes two values: show or hide. The example here shows the subtle difference. In most browsers that do not support this property, empty table cell borders are generally hidden.
filter=Specifies a filter for the element to render and any parameters that the filter takes. You can specify multiple filters.
float=This property influences the horizontal alignment of an element, making it "float" toward the left or right margin of its containing element. Possible values are left, right, and none. Floated regions act much like <img> tags that have been aligned left or right with respect to text.
font=This property provides a shorthand way to specify all font properties with one style rule. 
font-family=This property sets the font face for text. It is equivalent to the face attribute of a <font> tag. Fonts may be named specifically or a generic font family name may be used. When multiple font names are specified and separated by commas, they are read in descending order looking for the first match. Generally, a generic font name will be listed at the end of a font list. There are five generic font names currently available: serif, sans-serif, cursive, fantasy, and monospace. Their renderings under modern browsers are shown here, but beware that they may not render the same in all browsers.
font-size=This property sets the font size of text. Options include exact sizes set with points (pt), pixels (px), picas (pc), inches (in), millimeters (mm), and centimeters (cm). Standard relative sizing units in em (em) and x-height (ex) may also be used, as well as the relative size keywords larger and smaller and percentage value (for example, 90%).
font-size-adjust=This property is used for scaled fonts to make sure that text takes up the same amount of room regardless of the availability of a particular font or not. According to specification, when used properly the property helps ensure the x-height of the first font in a font selection list is maintained for subsequent fonts in the list. This property takes a number, which specifies the scaling factor to be used to adjust fonts. The default value of none does not preserve the font's x-height.
font-size-stretch=This property is used to stretch or condense a font and takes values of ultra-condensed, extracondensed, condensed, semi-condensed, normal, semi-expanded, expanded, extra-expanded, and ultra-expanded. The property also can take a relative value of wider or narrower to modify the appearance of text relative to a parent font. The default value is normal and is used to override inherited font-size-stretch values. At the time of this edition's writing, this property was yet to be supported by any major browser.
font-style=This property sets the style of a font to normal, oblique, or italic. Sometimes font style can be controlled using a specific font (for example, Times New Roman Italic).
font-variant=This property sets a variation of the specified or default font family. Values currently supported are normal and small-caps. The small-caps value sets text in smaller size all capitals. This style is often used in legal documents and license agreements. The normal value would be used to override any inherited font-variant value.
font-weight=This property sets the weight, or relative boldness, of a font. Values can be set with named values (normal or bold) or with numbered values (100-900).
height=This property sets the height of an element's content region (excluding padding, border, and margin). It is generally used on positioned block elements. Absolute measurements as well as percentage values are allowed. Percentage values are based on the height of the containing element. The default value auto automatically calculates the height of an element, based on the height of the containing element and the size of the content. Negative values are not allowed.
ime-mode=Specifies the state of the Input Method Editor (IME) for the element, which allows users to enter and edit Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters.    
layout-flow=Specifies the flow direction for the content of the element.
layout-grid=Defines the set of layout-grid properties for an element.    
layout-grid-char=Specifies the size of a character grid for the content of an element.
layout-grid-line=Specifies the grid line value for the text content of an element.
layout-grid-mode=Specifies if the element text layout grid uses the line and/or char mode.
layout-grid-type=Specifies the type of layout grid for the content of an element.        
left=This property defines the x (horizontal) coordinate for a positioned element, relative to the left side of the containing element or browser window. Given that the containing element itself may be positioned, the value of left does not always relate to the distance from the browser window. Values can be specified as lengths (inches, pixels, and so on), as a percentage of the containing object's dimensions, or as auto.
letter-spacing=This property sets the amount of spacing between letters. Values can be set in various units (negative values are permitted) or to the default value normal. Because you can't cross tags, you may not have full control over inter-character spacing; in other words, the letter-spacing property should not be confused with the ability to fully kern text.
line-break=Specifies line-breaking rules for Japanese text.
line-height=This property sets the height (leading) between lines of text in a block-level element such as a paragraph. Values can be specified as a number of lines, a number of units (pixels, points, inches, centimeters, and so on), or a percentage of the font size. This property is often used in conjunction with the font-size property. Alternatively, the line-height can be set through the shorthand font property.
list-style=This shorthand property sets list-style-type, list-style-position and list-style-image. In practice, the properties can appear in any order, but they ought to be written in the presented order.
list-style-image=This property assigns a graphic image to a list label, using the URL of the image. The value for list-style-image other than a URL is none.
list-style-position=This property specifies whether the labels for an element's list items are positioned inside or outside the "box" defined by the list. The difference is illustrated clearly here.
list-style-type=This property defines labels for ordered and unordered lists or elements that have their display property set to list-item. The value none prevents a list label from displaying. CSS1 defines disc, circle, and square, which are typically used on unordered lists (<ul>). The values decimal, lower-roman, upper-roman, lower-alpha, and upper-alpha are typically used on ordered lists (<ol>). These property types correspond to the HTML/XHTML type attributes for lists. CSS2 adds more type values primarily for ordered lists in foreign languages. The CSS2 values include decimal-leading-zero, lower-greek, lower-latin, upper-latin, hebrew, armenian, georgian, cjk-ideographic, hiragana, katakana, hiragana-iroha, and katakana-iroha.
margin=Defines the widths (in pixels, points, or a percentage) for the margins for the element.    
margin-bottom=This property sets an element's bottom margin and can be any normal measurement value as well as a negative value.
margin-left=This property sets an element's left margin and can be any normal measurement value as well as a negative value.
margin-right=This property sets an element's right margin and can be any normal measurement value as well as a negative value.
margin-top=This property sets an element's top margin and can be any normal measurement value as well as a negative value.
marker-offset=This property specifies the distance between the nearest border edges of a marker box and its associated surrounding box. The value may be specified in any length unit either relative or absolute. Lengths may be negative. So far, this property is not supported by any major browser.
marks=Defines if during printing cross marks (cross) or crop marks (crop) are rendered just outside a page box edge. In order to see these indications, your printed page size may have to be adjusted smaller.
max-height=Defines the maximum height a region may expand to if it is relatively sized. Measurements are generally in fixed values although relative units such as percentages may be used.
max-width=Defines the maximum width a region may expand to if it is relatively sized. Useful to constrain large regions of text from having overly long lines, which can result in readability problems. Measurements are generally in fixed values although relative units such as percentages may be used
min-height=Defines the minimum height a region may reduce to if it is relatively sized and the browser window is adjusted. Measurements are generally in fixed values although relative units such as percentages may be used.
min-width=Defines the minimum width a region may reduce to if it is relatively sized and the browser window is adjusted. Measurements are generally in fixed values although relative units such as percentages may be used.
orphans=Defines the minimum number of lines of a paragraph that must be left at the bottom of a page. This property is really only meaningful in a paged environment such as print output. The default value is 2 if unspecified.
-moz-binding=Specifies the URL of an XBL file to bind to the element. (Mozilla)
-moz-border-bottom-colors=Specifies one or more colors to use in a striping effect on the bottom border of the element. (Mozilla)
-moz-border-left-colors=Specifies one or more colors to use in a striping effect on the left border of the element. (Mozilla)
-moz-border-radius=Specifies the radius of the border around the element. (Mozilla)
-moz-border-radius-bottomleft=Specifies the border radius of the bottom-left corner of the element. (Mozilla)
-moz-border-radius-bottomright=Specifies the border radius of the bottom-right corner of the element. (Mozilla)
-moz-border-radius-topleft=Specifies the border radius of the top-left corner of the element. (Mozilla)
-moz-border-radius-topright=Specifies the border radius of the top-right corner of the element. (Mozilla)
-moz-border-right-colors=Specifies one or more colors to use in a striping effect on the right border of the element. (Mozilla)
-moz-border-top-colors=Specifies one or more colors to use in a striping effect on the top border of the element. (Mozilla)
-moz-opacity=Specifies the level of opacity for the element. Use a two-digit decimal. (Mozilla)                       
-moz-outline=Mozilla-specific version of the outline property. Defines the properties for an outline drawn over the outer edge of an element. (Mozilla)
-moz-outline-color=Mozilla-specific version of the outline-color property that specifies the color for an outline. Specify either a color name or RGB color code. (Mozilla)
-moz-outline-style=Mozilla-specific version of the outline-style property that specifies a style for an outline. (Mozilla)
-moz-outline-width=Mozilla-specific version of the outline-width property that specifies the width of the outline. (Mozilla)
-moz-user-focus=Specifies the behavior of the element when it receives focus. (Mozilla)
-moz-user-input=Specifies whether or not the element has input focus. (Mozilla)
-moz-user-modify=Specifies if a user can change the contents of the element. (Mozilla)
-moz-user-select=Specifies the content selection behavior for the element. (Mozilla)
-o-link=Specifies the value for the link variable. (Opera)
-o-link-source=Specifies the source anchor for the element. (Opera)                   
opacity=Specifies the transparency of an element. Specify a value between 0.0-1.0.
orphans=Specifies the minimum number of lines of text that an element must have left at the bottom of a page for printing.        
outline=This property is a shorthand form that sets all outline properties at once. Outlines resemble borders but take up no additional space, and can be set to a shape different from that of the image, form field, or other element to which they are applied. Outlines are drawn over an item, rather than around it, thus causing no reflow. The shorthand syntax is as follows:
outline-color=This property accepts all CSS color
outline-style=This property defines a style for an element's outline, which is generally the same as its border-style. While outlines resemble borders, they are not supposed to take up canvas space, and theoretically could appear as a different shape than borders, potentially wrapping around the edges of content. Since outlines are drawn over an item, rather than around it, there is no reflow. The allowed values for this property are the same as border-style and include none, dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, and outset. See border-style property for specific information on each style.
outline-width=This property defines a width for an element's outline, which is generally the same as its border-width. While outlines resemble borders, they are not supposed to take up canvas space, and theoretically could appear as a different shape than borders. Furthermore, outlines are drawn over an item, rather than around it, thus causing no reflow. Like border-width, this property's values can be keywords (thin, medium, or thick) and numerical lengths such as pixels (px), inches (in), and so on.
overflow=This property determines an element's behavior when its content doesn't fit into the space defined by the element's other properties. Possible values are visible, hidden, scroll, auto or inherit. By default, content will be visible, but a value of hidden will clip content that extends past the defined region size. A value of scroll adds scroll bars appropriately so content can be viewed.
overflow-x=Specifies how to handle content overflow of an element if the content is too wide for the element.
overflow-y=Specifies how to handle content overflow of an element if the content is too tall for the element.        
padding=The padding properties set the space between an element's border and its content. The padding property sets the padding for all four sides; the other four properties set the padding for specific sides. Values can be specified as specific values (pixels, points, and so on) or as a percentage of the element's overall width. The shorthand property is similar to margin. A single value creates equal padding on all sides. Up to four values can be used, in the following clockwise order: top, right, bottom, and left. Any missing value defaults to the value defined for the side opposite to it. However, unlike the margin property, the padding property cannot take negative values.
padding-bottom=This property sets the distance between an element's bottom border and the bottom of its contained content.
padding-left=This property sets the distance between an element's left border and the left edge of its content.
padding-right=This property sets the distance between an element's right border and the rightmost edge of its content.
padding-top=This property sets the distance between an element's top border and the top of its content.
page=Defines the type of page where an element should be displayed. The page is defined and named with an @page selector.
page-break-after=This property is used to control page breaks when printing a document. The property is set relative to the end of an element. A value of always forces a page break after the element. A value of avoid attempts to avoid a page break after the element. A value of left forces one or two page breaks after the element so that the next page is considered a left page. A value of right forces one or two page breaks after the element so the next page is considered a right page. The default value of auto neither forces nor forbids a page break.
page-break-before=This property is used to control page breaks when printing a document. This property is set relative to the start of an element. A value of always forces a page break before the element. A value of avoid attempts to avoid a page break before the element. A value of left forces one or two page breaks before the element so that the next page is considered a left page. A value of right forces one or two page breaks before the element so the next page is considered a right page. The default value of auto neither forces nor forbids a page break.
page-break-inside=This property is used to force or prohibit a printing page break within an element. A value of always forces a page break within the element. A value of avoid attempts to avoid a page break within the element. A value of left forces one or two page breaks within the element so that the next page is considered a left page. Avalue of right forces one or two page breaks within the element so the next page is considered a right page. The default value of auto neither forces nor forbids a page break.
pause=Specifies the number of seconds or milliseconds to pause before and/or after an element before playing audio content.
pause-after=Specifies the number of seconds or milliseconds to pause after an element before playing audio content.
pause-before=Specifies the number of seconds or milliseconds to pause before an element before playing audio content.            
pitch=Specifies the frequency of a speaking voice for audio content.
pitch-range=Specifies the range of the pitch of a speaking voice for audio content.
play-during=Specifies a sound to play while the content of the element is being spoken.            
position=This property defines how an element is positioned relative to other elements, using the values static, absolute, fixed, and relative. When positioned absolute, the left, right, top, and bottom properties define the element's precise location, using the affected element's upper-left corner (0,0) as reference. Because elements can contain other elements, 0,0 is not necessarily the upper-left corner of the browser window. When a relative position is used, offsets will be related to the object's natural position in the document flow. An element with absolute position will be set at the defined coordinates regardless to its position within the document, but will scroll with a window. An object with a fixed position will stay in position onscreen as things scroll. The default value static places elements according to the natural order in which they occur in a document.
quotes=This property defines the style of quotation marks to be used with embedded quotations. A value of none produces no quotation marks. Two strings can also be given for the left and rightmost quotation symbols.
richness=Specifies the richness of the speaking voice for audio content.    
right=This property defines the x (horizontal) coordinate for a positioned element, relative to the right side of either the containing element or browser window if directly within the <body>. Values can be specified as lengths (inches, pixels, and so on), as a percentage of the containing object's dimensions, or as auto. Most browsers assume pixels as the measure if not defined explicitly.
ruby-align=Specifies the alignment for ruby text. (IE)
ruby-overhang=Specifies the overhang of ruby text.
ruby-position=Specifies the position of ruby text.            
scrollbar-3dlight-color=Specifies the color of the top and left edges of the scroll box and scroll arrows of a scroll bar. (IE)
scrollbar-arrow-color=Specifies the color of the arrow of a scroll bar. (IE)
scrollbar-base-color=Specifies the color of the main elements of a scroll bar. (IE)
scrollbar-darkshadow-color=Specifies the color of the gutter of a scroll bar. (IE)
scrollbar-face-color=Specifies the color of the scroll box and arrows of a scroll bar. (IE)
scrollbar-highlight-color=Specifies the color of the top and left edges of the scroll box and arrows of a scroll bar. (IE)
scrollbar-shadow-color=Specifies the color of the bottom and right edges of the scroll box and arrows of a scroll bar. (IE)
scrollbar-track-color=Specifies the color of the track element of a scroll bar. (IE)
size=This property specifies the size and orientation of a page box for printing. The size may either be "absolute" (fixed size) or "relative" (scalable, i.e., fitting available sheet sizes). Relative values include landscape and portrait. The default value is auto.
speak=Specifies how the content will be rendered as audio content.
speak-header=For audio content, specifies whether table headers are spoken before every cell or just once until the header changes.
speak-numeral=For audio content, specifies whether numerals are spoken as individual digits or continuous numbers.
speak-punctuation=For audio content, specifies whether punctuation characters will be spoken or read as pauses.
speech-rate=For audio content, specifies the speaking rate.            
stress=For audio content, specifies the number of inflection points in the voice.
table-layout=This property controls the algorithm used to lay out the table cells, rows, and columns. A value of fixed uses the fixed table layout algorithm, which relays not the content of the cells but simply the width of the tables, columns, borders, and defined cell spacing. This should result in faster page rendering. The default value of auto uses the standard automatic table layout algorithm, which may require multiple passes or take perceptible time to calculate, particularly when the table is complex or heavily nested.
text-align=This property sets the horizontal alignment of elements. Values are left, right, center, and justify. The default value is left. This property is similar to the align attribute available with HTML/ XHTML block-level tags such as <p>. Justification may produce poor results: showing white space "rivers" in large text bodies because of screen resizing.
text-align-last=Specifies the alignment for the last or only line of text for the element. (IE)
text-decoration=This property defines specific text effects. Possible values are blink, line-through, overline, underline, and none. The blink value is actually part of the CSS2 specification but is not supported in IE up to version 6. The text-decoration property is often used with the a element and its associated pseudoclasses (a:active, a:hover, a:link, and a:visited) to turn off link underlining or set different looks for hover or visited states.
text-indent=This property indents the text in the first line of a block-level element. Values can be defined as length values (.5cm, 15px, 12pt, and so on) or as a percentage of the width of the block element. The default value is 0, which indicates no indentation.
text-justify=Specifies the alignment to use to justify the text for the element.
text-overflow=Specifies whether to use ellipses (...) to indicate text overflow.
text-shadow=This as yet unimplemented CSS2 property sets a shadow effect for text. The shadow is defined by a comma-separated list of shadow effects to be applied to the text of the element. The shadow effects are applied in the order specified and may overlay each other, but they will never overlay the text itself. Each shadow effect must specify a shadow offset and may optionally specify a blur radius and a shadow color.
text-transform=This property transforms the case of the affected text. Possible values are capitalize, uppercase, lowercase, and none. Note that a value of capitalize will affect every word in the selected text rather than first word only. The value of none is used to override any inherited text-transform values.
top=This property defines the y (vertical) coordinate for a positioned element, relative to the top of the enclosing object or browser window. Values can be specified as lengths (inches, pixels, and so on), as a percentage of the containing object's dimensions, or as auto, which lets this property function as determined by the browser or as defined by the parent element. Browsers often assume pixels as a default measurement if none is specified.
unicode-bidi=This property allows the text direction to be overridden to support multiple languages in the same document. The value normal uses the standard direction and rendering. A value of embed allows a new level of embedding to change direction while bidi-override allows the direction property to override any predefined direction.
vertical-align=This property sets the vertical positioning of text and images with respect to the baseline setting. Possible values are baseline, sub, super, top, text-top, middle, bottom, and text-bottom. A value of top aligns the top of text or images with the top of the tallest element, relative to the baseline. A value of text-top aligns the top of text or images with the top of the font in the containing element while text-bottom aligns things with the bottom of the font. A value of middle aligns the middle of text or images to the middle of the x-height of the containing element. A value of bottom aligns the bottom of text or images with the bottom of the lowest element, relative to the baseline. The sub and super values provide subscript and superscript style. Percentages can also be given as values. The default value is baseline.
visibility=This property determines whether or not an element is visible. Possible values are hidden, visible, and inherit. Be aware that a hidden element still occupies its full canvas space, but because this property is often used in conjunction with z-index, this may not matter. The default value inherit specifies that an element inherits its visibility state from the element that contains it. CSS2 defines a collapse value for this property that is often used with table cells. This property is commonly accessed via JavaScript to show and hide page objects in a manner often dubbed DHTML (Dynamic HTML).
voice-family=Specifies the speaking voice for audio content.
volume=Specifies the sound volume for audio content.
white-space=This property controls how spaces, tabs, and newline characters are handled in an element. Possible values are normal, pre, and nowrap. The normal value collapses multiple white space characters into single spaces and automatically wraps lines, as in normal HTML/XHTML. The pre value makes the element act much like a <pre> tag and preserves all white space. The value of nowrap prevents lines from wrapping if they exceed the element's content width.
widows=Defines the minimum number of lines in a paragraph to be left at the top of a page. This property is really only meaningful in a paged environment such as print output. The default value is 2 if unspecified.
width=This property sets the width of an element's content region (excluding padding, border, and margin). Standard length units can be used and pixels (px) is often the assumed measurement in browsers. Percentage values, based on the width of the containing element, can also be used. The default value of auto automatically calculates the width of an element, based on the width of the containing element and the size of the content.
word-break=Specifies line-breaking behavior between words in the content of the element.
word-spacing=This property sets the spacing between words. Values can be set in inches (in), centimeters (cm), millimeters (mm), points (pt), picas (pc), em spaces (em), or pixels (px). Negative values are possible with this property, and may be used either for interesting effects or to create unreadable text. A default value of normal sets word spacing to the standard browser setting.
word-wrap=Specifies line-breaking behavior for words that are longer than their container boundaries.
writing-mode=Specifies the direction and flow of content in the element.
z-index=This property defines a layering context with relative or absolute positioning for elements containing other elements. By default, overlapping elements stack in the order in which they are defined in an HTML/XHTML document. This property can override default layering by assigning numeric layering values to an element, with higher numbers layering above lower numbers. The auto value tries to determine the z-placement of an element automatically by its order in the document.
zoom=Specifies the magnification scale for the element.
